/*    INTRODUCTION
 *    ============
 *    Welcome to the CSS file! This is subjectively the most exciting code
 *    of the website. Here we bring together the visual style of the website.
 *
 *    This CSS is organized using Harry Roberts' (csswizardry.com) Inverted
 *    Triangle CSS (ITCSS) organizational approach. This method is mixed with
 *    Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming convention for class names throughout
 *    the stylesheet.
 *
 *    Table of Contents:
 * 1. Settings
 * 2. Tools
 * 3. Generic
 * 4. Elements
 * 5. Objects
 * 6. Components
 * 7. Vendors
 * 8. Utilities

/* =====================================================================
 * 1. Settings
 *    When using a preprocessor, settings are used to define variable.
 *    This puts variables at the top of the cascade so they are accessible
 *    to all partials further down. No CSS selectors should be generated
 *    by the preprocessor from partials in this section.
 *
 *    When not using a preprocessor, the settings area is a good place
 *    to write comments describing the colors and font stacks as a guide.
 *    If using features such as custom properties, those that are global
 *    custom properties should be described in this section.
 */

/* =====================================================================
 * 2. Tools
 *    This section is specifically for preprocessor global mixins and
 *    functions. No CSS should be generated by the preprocessor from
 *    partials in this section. UNUSED IN THIS PROJECT
 */

/* =====================================================================
 * 3. Generic
 *    Here we define any generic styles that are not specific to the styles of
 *    the site. This section should include any Reset or Normalize libraries
 *    and any preferential base styles for elements. There shouldnâ€™t be any
 *    classes or ids used in this section.

/* =====================================================================
 * 4. Elements
 *    Styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with
 *    default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
