I have been wanting to read Mary Beard for some years ever since I learned about her book SPQR. But, I’ve put off picking up her works until now, and I’m glad this was my introduction to her work. Beard brings to the forefront how the suppression of women during ancient Greece and Rome is still alive and well in Western Civilization today.
