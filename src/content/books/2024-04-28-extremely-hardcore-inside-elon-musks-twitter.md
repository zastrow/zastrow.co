Zoë Schiffer’s provides a deeply researched and developed account of the the moment Elon Musk tweeted he’d buy Twitter, up through the end of the first year after he took over. I found this to be a page turner that provided further depth on stories I had heard or read through her reporting on Platformer. All-in-all, it’s amazing X Corp. hasn’t announced bankruptcy as of this writing.
