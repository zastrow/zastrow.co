Beautiful and harrowing novel told through the lives and experiences of Japanese immigrants to the Western United Stated from turn of the 20th century up to the mass detainment during World War 2. I learned so much through this book that was difficult to put down. What I found most impressive is that the protagonist is not a person but a people, with each sentence providing a perspective.
