Excellent book. When we view those with a disability of some form as needing fixed or that a technological innovation will cure them, their individuality and desires are ignored. After finishing up _Under a White Sky_, I have been very aware of how human interventions always have unintended or unexpected consequences, and technoableism is no different.
