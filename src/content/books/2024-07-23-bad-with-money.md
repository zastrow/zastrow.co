I have considered reading this book for years. In part because I think I am bad with money, but know I know more than I give myself credit. However, Dunn’s book title instilled a honesty I never see from financial books.
Bad With Money is the perfect book for those transitioning from teenager to adult to get a level-head grip on the weird world of every day finances. It’s also a really good book for anyone just trying to figure all this shit out, because none of us fully understand it all.
What stood out to me for this book was the thesis early on as Dunn discusses the scripts we follow when it comes to money and that these scripts get instilled in us early in life as the grown-ups in our lives grapple with understanding money, too. As I read Dunn’s own account of her life and how it informed her money scripts, I realized my own money script revolved around fear and shame. Recognizing that, I hope to dig more into the roots of that.
That’s not all though, Dunn covers everything from making money, saving, investing, to the blight of the student loan system and wedding industries taking advantage of uninformed youth. Dunn also covers things you may not consider like a will and how we can be part of changing how our society relates to and perceives finances and money.
I absolutely loved Dunn’s insight and humor as she interweaved her personal story with financial insights she’s gleaned over the years. I highly recommend this book even if you feel very confident in your financial understanding as Dunn’s own perspective reminded me how differently everyone’s experience is as we figure life.
