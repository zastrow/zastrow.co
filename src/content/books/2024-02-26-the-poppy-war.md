I don’t quite know what to say about this book. After this one, I want to read everything Kuang has written, and might make that a goal for the year. I will certainly have to finish the trilogy at the least.
When I first read the premise, this seemed like it ought to be labeled YA. A young, neglected kid rises above the expectations of their abusive guardians to join an elite school and find their hidden power. But this is far beyond that stereotypical synopsis and makes itself known that it is no YA story. Here, the dangers are real, the war is grizzly, and the awkward love triangles don’t exist.
I found this to be a page turner in every way I would want. I was left so often wanting to keep reading, but also with a desire to pause and digest what I had just finished reading. Now I have to consider whether to pause and pick up a different book or the sequel.
