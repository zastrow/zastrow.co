I have not seen The Room yet, but after reading Greg’s account of its production I hope to rectify that soon. The Room is considered The Citizen Kane of bad movies, another movie I have yet to see, and I've seen plenty of YouTube clips to understand why. Sestero’s account presents the heart and mind of the man behind the film, well as best as he can at least. Moreover, this is a story of an unlikely and difficult friendship.
