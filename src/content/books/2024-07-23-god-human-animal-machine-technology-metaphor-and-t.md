I was drawn to this book from the perspective as someone seeing similarities with the Posthuman/Transhuman push from the techno-authoritarians and that of Christian fundamentalism. Indeed, O’Gieblyn takes on both and more in a fascinating exploration of the metaphors that transcend humanity, religions, and systems that are religion in all but name.
