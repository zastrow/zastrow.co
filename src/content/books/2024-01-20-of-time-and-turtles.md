Another beautiful account from Sy Montgomery, exploring the depths of a particular group of creatures. I did not realize the very intentional threat turtles face through various acts of humanity to poach and profit. These are creatures I have long been fascinated by, and this book introduced me to people that have devoted their lives to the well-being of these slow neighbors. As Sy often does, I’m left with a new-found respect for the topical animal.
