I’ve read both Kolbert’s _Field Notes From a Catastrophe_ and _The Sixth Extension_, both of which highlight the effects of the Anthropocene. While _Under a White Sky_ dives more in to how as we try to solve problems, we inevitably cause more problems, which cyclically leads to more damage and more problems to solve. Kolbert explores many examples of what has been done, what is being fixe, and where we are theorizing other solutions and trying to anticipate the damage the solution may cause.
