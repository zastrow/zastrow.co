J.D. Vance is a year younger than me and we grew up in the same area of Ohio. We both have Appalachian family as well. Many things sounded familiar, not from personal experience, but from observing and living amongst many of the same folks. I found this book to be a wonder reminder of who many of my neighbors are, and what there story looks like.
