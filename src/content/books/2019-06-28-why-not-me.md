I really enjoyed listening to Mindy Kaling talk through many different aspects of her life and some alternative universe what ifs. The part that struck me the most was the final chapter where she addresses a question she is asked often “how she is so confident.” Her thoughts on the matter were very encouraging for me as I’ve been learning over the years how to be confident, but wanting to stay humble as my confidence grows.
