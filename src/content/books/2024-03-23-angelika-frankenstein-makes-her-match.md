I really should have realized this was necrophilia by the title. However, I thought it was in the spirit of something like *Pride and Prejudice and Zombies*. And while the main character fantasized her formerly-dead piecemeal creation vividly, there was just enough story thread to keep me going until I realized I was actively avoiding reading altogether.
In order to appease my completionist mindset, I skimmed and skipped through the remainder of the book to mark it as read. The characters lacked anything that made them the least bit interesting, and by the end I found now substantial development to the characters or the story.
