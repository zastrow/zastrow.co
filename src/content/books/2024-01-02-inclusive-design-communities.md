A Book Apart Books always bring quality in words, ideas, and the physical product itself. The paper quality, and layout choices are of equal quality as the author, topic, and writing. Sameera’s book is no different. While it is called Inclusive Design Communities it could also be called Being an Empathetic Human. So much of her ideas and thoughts in this book transcend the tech industry and can be applied to any place humans gather.
