Excellent memoir by an incredible and inspiring CEO. I found Nooyi’s personal perspective from her life fascinating and inspiring as she brought those experiences to create meaningful and impactful change. Here influence was not limited to PepsiCo but beyond to the partners, workers, and even nations with which the company is involved. I think anyone can learn a lot from her story and experiences, and I think there are many opportunities to carry her work in the next generation.
