Accessibility has as much art as it does science. While there are firm criteria, how those are interpreted and understood can vary. That does not preclude my site from being the most accessible that it can be, but I am a single person doing my darnedest. I try to stick to [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) as best I can.

I run tests with [axeDevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/), manual screen reader tests, manual keyboard testing, and as many browser tests as I have available to me.

I find accessibility happens best through community. If you encounter any issues, please add an issue to [the site repo](https://github.com/zastrow/zastrow.co/issues).
