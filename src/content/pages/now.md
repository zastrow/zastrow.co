I am sitting outside. It's 74°F and sunny with a nice breeze. The cicadas are starting to quiet down, though one perked up as I was writing this sentence. They are so loud.

I have some new projects in the pipeline, but I'm in the midsts of figuring out some new life rhythms with my family.

If you want though, keep an eye on [Cereal Syndicate](https://cerealsyndicate.co) and [Startup Unknown](https://startupunknown.com). This is the first place I've mentioned these ideas online. If you happen to keep up with this ephemeral page, I'm sure I'll drop some info about those projects soon.
