## Philip

Hi! I’m Philip. I’m a Front End Designer and Developer at [Box Out](https://boxoutsports.com) with a passion for bridging design and development, with a keen interest in user interfaces and accessibility.

I have taught and trained designers and developers through the [Sparkbox apprenticeship programs](http://apprentices.seesparkbox.com/) and as an adjunct instructor at [The Modern College of&nbsp;Design](https://themodern.edu).

My writing on various web topics can be found on the [Sparkbox Foundry](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/author/philip_zastrow) or here [on this site](/posts). I also wrote a [tutorial series about CSS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css).

I’m always looking for a [good book](/books) to read. Lately, you can find me hanging out around the&nbsp;<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@zastrow">Fediverse</a>.

## Site

This site is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), a term I learned from [Rach Smith’s Blog](https://rachsmith.com). It’s been through many phases since the early aughts, including a domain change which should still points here. I’ve used many different tools over the years, but here are some of the players in this current iteration:

<dl>
<dt><a href="https://11ty.dev" rel="external">Eleventy</a></dt>
<dd>This is an incredible static site generator that I fell in love with in 2023 and am so excited to be using on my personal site. I highly recommend it.</dd>

<dt>Fonts</dt>
<dd>I’m using <a href="https://github.com/mona-sans">Mona Sans</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mona-sans">Hubot Sans</a>, and <a href="https://monaspace.githubnext.com">Monaspace Neon</a>, all variable fonts produced by GitHub.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a></dt>
<dd>Hosting for the site. It’s nice and easy to setup and run, and the free tier is quite generous.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/zastrow/zastrow.co">GitHub</a></dt>
<dd>My primary place to store my code, including this site. It’s a publicly viewable repo, so if you find a typo or a bug, please submit an issue!</dd>

<dt><a href="https://open-props.style">Open Props</a></dt>
<dd>While I still have a lot of custom styling, I am relying a great deal on excellent Open Props library of CSS Custom Properties. It is a well-thought through library and it uses a lot of conventions I already followed. I’m applying these values to my site via the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/postcss-jit-props">PostCSS JIT plugin</a>, which only adds the properties I’m actually using.</dd>
</dl>

## Design Inspirations

Lastly, I must share about the inspiration of this current design. It is based on a print I have by [Lil Tuffy](https://www.lil-tuffy.com/) that I received from [Ari Stiles](https://about.me/arianne) when she was clearing out some old decor. It says “CSS” in the middle and has the pink and orange color palette I’ve been using with this site for many years. I am so grateful to Ari and the dearly missed, [Christopher Schmidt](https://thankyouchristopherschmitt.netlify.app) for giving me so many opportunities to speak at their events.
