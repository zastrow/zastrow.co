## Hardware

My primary computer is a 16-inch M1 MacBook Pro. I work at a Fully Jarvis adjustable height desk with a Steelcase Leap for when I am sitting. I use a Twelve South BookArc to hold my Mac in clamshell mode and connected to two displays: a 27-inch LG Ultrafine 5K in landscape and a 24" Dell 4K in portrait. I use both an Apple Trackpad and an Apple Mouse positioned on the left and right sides of my keyboard, respectively. My keyboard is a Keychron Q2 with a knob and I use Gatreon Brown switches. Additionally, I have an Elgato Stream Deck, powered by BetterTouchTool, an Elgato Keylight Air, and an AudioTechnica ATR2100x-USB microphone attached to an Elgato Mic Arm LP.

My phone is an iPhone 13 Mini, which does as my webcam using Continuity Camera.
