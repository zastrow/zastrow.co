## Hardware

My primary computer is a 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro. I work at a Fully Jarvis adjustable height desk with a Steelcase Leap for when I am sitting. I use a [Twelve South BookArc](https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/bookarc-for-macbook) to hold my Mac in clamshell mode and connected to an [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/) and a older Dell 4K in portrait orientation. I use both an [Apple Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMMP3AM/A/magic-trackpad-black-multi-touch-surface?fnode=3e15868f383af569056d85cc5368ede626c647436e7a1307dda6c39b08eafd38de466773d9299bf4c8e5d0f82bb1b964dd748dc28362079e3138a52627ae799c110beff950da4401e4530de03ba03f785d25964a1cfbe73bc79796c3f37caf39) and an [Apple Mouse](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMMQ3AM/A/magic-mouse-black-multi-touch-surface) positioned on the left and right sides of my keyboard, respectively. My keyboard is a [Keychron Q2 with a knob](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q2-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard?variant=39986978652249) and I use Gatreon Brown switches. Additionally, I have an [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-mk2-white), powered by [BetterTouchTool](https://docs.folivora.ai/docs/1300_stream_deck.html), an [Elgato Keylight Air](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/key-light-air), and an [AudioTechnica ATR2100x-USB](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/atr2100x-usb) microphone attached to an [Elgato Mic Arm LP](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/wave-mic-arm-lp).

My phone is an iPhone 16 Pro, which acts as my webcam using [Continuity Camera](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102546). It is connected to a [gooseneck stand](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=gooseneck) via a [MagSafe adapter mount](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYDDTRQ4).

## Software

There is so much software I want to list, because I use a lot of it. I should start off with saying I’m a [Setapp](https://go.setapp.com/invite/06edebd7-193d-4ddb-99c3-74efafd39d23) subscriber since it was in beta and many of my daily apps come from there. It’s the best, and longest-lasting subscription I’ve ever had…including video streaming.
