If you have followed along with my site this year, I have made some mention in my [/now](/now) page and in a previous [weeknote](/posts/2024/01/26/weeknotes-2024-4/) that I have been job hunting. Additionally I mentioned in my last [weeknote](/posts/2024/02/02/weeknotes-2024-5/) that I was doing contract work with my friends at [Box Out](https://boxoutsports.com). Well, as of this week I am now a full-time employee of Box Out Designs, LLC. I cannot express just how excited I am about this new role and getting to work with friends I have looked up to since I met them over a decade ago.

While I look forward to this next chapter in my career, I am equally sad to see my time at Sparkbox officially come to a close. I returned my Sparkbox equipment today and a decade of memories came rushing at me. I am so thankful for those amazing people I have met through this organization. I’m extra thankful for the friendships I have made that will long surpass my tenure. If you are at a company and in need of help with your web applications, the team at [Sparkbox](https://sparkbox.com) is still the best in the biz.

## Links

The links this week are a bit different, but my general goal with all the links is that they are things you may find useful or enjoy.

- [Frontend Design Conference](https://frontenddesignconference.com): I finally am going thanks to the encouragement of [Erik Runyon](https://erikrunyon.com). I have wanted to go to Frontend Design Conference since at least 2013 or 2014 and I’m so excited to finally go!
- [axe-con 2024](https://www.deque.com/axe-con/): Speaking of conferences, the accessibility conference from Deque, axe-con, is next week. It’s online, it’s free, you should plan on attending or at least watching later. Plus, one of my [former Sparkbox coworkers](https://www.deque.com/axe-con/speakers/lindsey-wild/) will be presenting!
- [Roost Laptop Stand](https://www.therooststand.com/collections/roost-laptop-stand/products/roost-v3-roost-laptop-stand): My new job is 100% remote, but my spouse and I agree that I need to get out of the house more. I’ve had a semi-mobile laptop stand for a few years, but I’ve upgraded to the sleek and compact Roost stand and I’m exited to give it a go.
- [Keychron K7 Max](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k7-max-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard): I finally hit buy on this one. For my desk setup, I have been rocking a [Keychron Q2](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q2-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard) with knob for a couple years and I love it. But, I’ve been wanting a wireless version I could take with me coffee shops and travel with. The Keychron K7 Max, a low-profile mechanical keyboard, seems to fit the bill. So, I order that along with a [travel case](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-travel-pouch) and an [extra set of keycaps](https://www.keychron.com/collections/keychron-low-profile-keycaps/products/low-profile-abs-full-set-keycap-set).
- [Shaggymax](https://www.shaggymax.com): My last new computer accessory should have been purchased ages ago. My biggest annoyance of using a laptop is how the oil from my fingers on the keys get imprinted on the screen. I did a bit of research and it seemed like the Shaggymax was the best solution to this problem.
