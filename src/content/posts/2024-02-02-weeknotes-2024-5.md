This week has been busy…which is a wonderful change of pace. I’ve been working with my friends at [Box Out Sports](http://boxoutsports.com). I’m very excited by this development, as it has given me an opportunity to reconnect with some old friends from my time working at Notre Dame. I even traveled to South Bend, Indiana last weekend to meet with the Box Out folks for their first ever [all-team dinner](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/box-out-sports_teamboxout-activity-7157743324253093888-0ip_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

## Design Systems Burnout

If you are not subscribed to Robin Rendle’s newsletter, *[The Cascade](https://robinrendle.com/the-cascade/)*, I highly recommend it. His latest post dropped on Sunday this week and, it brings up a very real issue facing design system teams, burnout. Even if you are not involved in design systems, or even know what they are, I think it is worth reading as Robin mentions two articles I went on to read, *[All Work is Care Work](https://www.jackcheng.com/sunday/414-all-work-is-care-work)* by Jack Cheng, and *‌[A unified theory of fucks](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/unified-theory-of------)* by Mandy Brown. All three of these articles have been weighing on my mind, especially as a design system consultant and someone who cares deeply about doing good work.

I have more thoughts I want to share on the topic, especially as I consider own moments of burnout, my appreciation for systems, and the future of my career.

## Vision Pro Personas

I’ve used VR/AR headsets before, but they’ve never really captured my attention. But, there are some aspects of the Vision Pro that do seem interesting to me, such as a virtual monitor connected when connected to a Mac. However, there is one aspect that is a complete turn off to me when it comes to this type of device: video calls. Apple’s solution to this is to create a digital personal that combines video data with machine learning to attempt a real-life depiction of the wearer.

[Justin Searls](http://justin.searls.co) recorded a video showing what this Persona effect looks like while doing a FaceTime call. It’s an interesting approach for a 1.0 or a product. While it looks awkward, I expect it will improve quite a bit. Although, I don’t know if it will get out of the [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) anytime soon.
