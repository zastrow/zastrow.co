This has been an exciting week. Last week, I put out a call to Mastodon for help since I’m into the 3rd month of furlough. This in turn put in my in contact with some old friends that through that post learned about my situation and they happened to be in need of a contractor for the next month. While I am still in the market for a permanent role, this seems like a light at the end the tunnel moment. Here are some highlights and interesting things from this week:

## A Thread Worth Reading

Sameera Kapila, author of *[Inclusive Design Communities](https://zastrow.co/books/2024-01-02-inclusive-design-communities)*, wrote an encouraging [thread this week on Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@samkap/111813934884245846). She briefly discusses the bashing that occurs among companies regarding developers who attended code schools. But the story she went on to tell about an experience she had, showcasing how solid workers have come from code schools. As a community college graduate, I was very encouraged by Sam’s story.

My choice to attend a community college was looked down on by some of my peers. Then, I’ve struggled with imposter syndrome about my Associate degree, especially when I worked at the University of Notre Dame. Lately, as I’ve been on the job hunt, I’ve seen time and again that a Bachelor degree under the requirements, and I will often dismiss those positions thinking I’ll be looked over because I lack that degree. Yet, I know I’ve had an incredible career in tech as a designer and developer for over 20 years. The language choice of your job descriptions may be dispelling your ideal candidate.

## New Tools

I learned about some new tools this week that have really impressed me and I have to share.

1. [Tuple](tuple.app) — Imagine Zoom, but build specifically around the idea of pair programming. The way this app works is so much more to what I want out of a video chat application, mainly windowing. Where Zoom keeps everything ins a single window regarding the video chat, Tuple’s primary concern is screen sharing with the video as an option secondary window. Plus it has an incredible feature of per app window hiding, so participants can’t see your email, messages, or any other app of your choosing.
2. [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com) — For years I have used RVM to manage Ruby versions and NVM use manage Node version. This week, I was run spinning up Ruby project for the first time in a while and kept running into issue after issue. A friend of mine suggested I try out ASDF (actually this same friend introduced me to RVM, come to think of it). Anyway I tried out ASDF and I was up and running in no time (though I did need [this project](https://github.com/raggi/openssl-osx-ca) to overcome an OpenSSL issue). He told me that he used it for Node version management as well. So, I switched it over and it did something I could _never_ get NVM to do, read and change nodes based on a `.nvmrc` file.
3. [Timery](https://timeryapp.com/) — I’ve been wanting to try out Timery for a very long time, but because of my job, I always was using Harvest, and it wasn’t worth it to me to try and either run two timers or run one and export data to the other. But, with doing some freelance work, I wanted to give it a try and it is quite nice. I had a few desktop widgets and a Shortcut to quickly start a timer, it was data I’ve wanted out of Harvest for years. Worth the hype I’ve heard.
4. [Mastofeed](https://mastofeed.org/) — One automation I’ve been trying to figure out is automatically posting new posts from my site to my [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@zastrow) account. While I’ve long been a big user of [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com), and indeed there are some automations for this site controlled by IFTTT, I wanted to try a different approach. Well, thankfully, [@sophie@social.lol](https://social.lol/@sophie/111813091040307637) asked the same question and brought Mastofeed to my attention.

## On The Blog

Lastly, [I wrote a post](http://localhost:8080/posts/2024/01/22/designed-in-the-browser/) earlier this week about my design in the browser process. What’s really great is I’m working on a new project where I get to put this process in practice, and I’m really excited about it. I should have more to share about that project soon.
