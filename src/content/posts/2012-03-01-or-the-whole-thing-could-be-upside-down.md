<p>A lot of <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/18487553880/liveblogging-the-ipad-home-button-revelation">hubbub</a> out there about what the next iPad will look like. Gizmodo has gone to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5888989/this-is-the-ipad-3-hiding-in-plain-sight">great lengths</a> to explain that the photo in Apple’s event announcement reveals that the new iPad will have no home button.</p>
<p>I’m curious just how disappointed these tech journalist will be when Apple names this new iPad the 2s instead of the 3.</p>
