Currently drinking a [Poet’s Dream](https://www.ginprof.com/post/the-poets-dream) my wife came across this from an author she follows on Instagram.

- 2 oz London Dry gin
- ¾ oz dry vermouth
- ¼ oz Bénédictine
- 2 dashes orange bitters

Quite good. It’s my first time trying Bénédictine, which seems like a milder version of Campari when mixed with Gin, not too bitter but just as earthy.
