Well, right now. I just launched my new website design and secondly I created this now page.

## What is a now page?

Well…it’s this page, but also it is this [whole concept](https://nownownow.com/about). And I’m giving it a shot, well, now.

I’ll probably make it somewhat dynamic at some point for my ease of updating.
