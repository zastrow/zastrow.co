## What else am I doing?

I got into cycling recently after having some knee issues running and I love it. I’ve also been listening to the [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com) podcast on recommendation from a friend, and the episode [Become A Better Writer In 60 Minutes](https://www.mfmpod.com/become-a-better-writer-in-60-minutes-masterclass/) gave me a lot of challenging ideas to improve my writing, I recommend it.

## What is a now page?

Well…it’s this page, but also it is this [whole concept](https://nownownow.com/about).
