## What else am I doing?

Sanding and painting my outdoor furniture. Unfortunately, one of the seats had some intense wood rot in one board. Thankfully, the primary frame is in tact, but I’ll need to rebuild the seat.

Also, I turn 40 next week, and I want to write a blog post before then.

## What is a now page?

Well…it’s this page, but also it is this [whole concept](https://nownownow.com/about). And I’m giving it a shot, well, now.
