## What else am I doing?

Headed to Las Vegas for the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, or NACDA, convention. Why am I going to a convention about college athletic directors? Because that is the primary audience for [Box Out](https://boxoutsports.com), where I work. I haven’t been to Vegas in 22 years, and I while I recall some interesting sites, I do remember that it wasn’t quite my thing. Despite that I really want to get to know the people for whom our product exists and how Box Out can meet their needs.

## What is a now page?

Well…it’s this page, but also it is this [whole concept](https://nownownow.com/about). And I’m giving it a shot, well, now.
