## What else am I doing?

Clearly I’m get old, because for my birthday I bought a lawn mower. It’s my second ever brand new lawn mower. My very first lawn mower was a manual push reel mower, that was perfect for our first house, which had a small yard. A couple moves and several hand-me-down lawn mowers later, I got tired of all the work and smell that came with the gas-powered mowers. So, for my birthday I got a battery-powered self-propelled lawn mower and I really, really like it.

## What is a now page?

Well…it’s this page, but also it is this [whole concept](https://nownownow.com/about). And I’m giving it a shot, well, now.
