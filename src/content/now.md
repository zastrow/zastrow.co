## What else am I doing?

**Still looking for a job.** If you have any leads for a front of the front end type developer/designer hybrid unicorn whatnot, please message me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@zastrow) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-zastrow/). I have over 20 years experience building web(sites|apps). I’m particularly keen on design systems and leading teams.

Thankfully, my initial callout on Mastodon led to reconnecting with some friends who gave me an opportunity to do some short-term contract work with their company, [Box Out](http://boxoutsports.com). 

## What is a now page?

Well…it’s this page, but also it is this [whole concept](https://nownownow.com/about). And I’m giving it a shot, well, now.
