## Getting Ready For Thanksgiving Day

It’s national holiday of Thanksgiving in the United State this week. Despite all the pushes of consumerism, it can be a rather lovely holiday. We usually keep the day low key with just my spouse and our kids, however this year we’ve invited a friend over to join us.

## Still pumped by RubyConf

I attended my first RubyConf a couple weeks ago. I’m still pumped and motivated by everyone I met. It’s lead to more conversations and I’m excited by the community and the ideas I have of things to build.

## Video Games

I just wrapped up The Legend of Zelda: Echos of Wisdom. I love that Nintendo made a new top down Zelda adventure and the mechanics and story were as joyful as ever. Playing as Zelda is a wonderful turn of events. I also really like that they retained the same aesthetic at the Link’s Awakening rerelease. I would love to see A Link to the Past or Minish Cap get this sort of treatment.

## What is a now page?

Well…it’s this page, but also it is this [whole concept](https://nownownow.com/about).
