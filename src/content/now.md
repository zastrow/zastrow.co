## Video Games

I wrapped up [Chants of Sennaar](https://www.rundisc.io/chants-of-sennaar/) last week and throughly enjoyed that game. Now, I’m on to [Cult of the Lamb](https://www.cultofthelamb.com/)

I recently got a Steam Deck and I love this device so much. As much as I want to be a computer gamer and buy computer video games, I prefer the convenience of playing on consoles and handhelds. I’m finally making progress on Baldur’s Gate 3 after switching from playing on my computer to the Steam Deck.

## Back to Work

After the holiday break, I’m prepping to start back at work this week. I’m excited to get back to it, and the break has been great.
