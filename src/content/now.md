## What else am I doing?

I’ve been buying new bags and gear for a trip next week to [Front-End Design Conference](http://frontenddesignconference.com) in St. Petersburg, Florida. There are a lot of people going that I haven’t seen in years, like old friends and coworkers. I am so excited!

## What is a now page?

Well…it’s this page, but also it is this [whole concept](https://nownownow.com/about). And I’m giving it a shot, well, now.
