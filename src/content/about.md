## Philip

Hi! I’m Philip. I’m a Developer at [Sparkbox](https://sparkbox.com) with a passion for bridging design and development with a focus on HTML, CSS, and Accessibility. I’m even a certified [Web Accessibility&nbsp;Specialist](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertificants#Certificants4)!</p>

I help teach and train designers and developers through the [Sparkbox apprenticeship programs](http://apprentices.seesparkbox.com/) and as an adjunct instructor at [The Modern College of&nbsp;Design](https://themodern.edu).

My writing on various web topics can be found on the [Sparkbox Foundry](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/author/philip_zastrow) or on [my website](/posts). I also have a [tutorial series about CSS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on the DigitalOcean Community site.

I’m always looking for a [good book](/books) to read. Lately, you can find me hanging out around the&nbsp;<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@zastrow">Fediverse</a>.

## Site

This site is my web garden. It’s been through many phases since the early aughts, including a domain change which still points here. I’ve used many different tools over the years, but here this is a notable use of what I am using now:

<dl>
<dt><a href="https://11ty.dev" rel="external">Eleventy</a></dt>
<dd>This is an incredible static site generator that I fell in love with in 2023 and am so excited to be using on my person site. I highly recommend it.</dd>

<dt>Fonts</dt>
<dd>I’m using Mona Sans, Hubot Sans, and Monaspace Neon, all variable fonts produced by GitHub.</dd>

<dt>Netlify</dt>
<dd>Hosting for the site. It’s nice and easy to setup and run, and the free tier is quite generous.</dd>

<dt>GitHub</dt>
<dd>My primary place to store my code, including this site. It’s a publicly viewable repo, so if you find a typo or a bug, please submit an issue!</dd>

## Design Inspirations

Lastly, I must share about the inspiration of this current design. It is based on a print I have by [Lil Tuffy](https://www.lil-tuffy.com/) that I received when Ari Stiles when she was clearing out some old decor. It says “CSS” in the middle and has the pink and orange color palette I’ve been using with this site for many years. I am so grateful to Ari and the late, and beloved Christopher Schmidt for giving me so many opportunities to speak at their events.
