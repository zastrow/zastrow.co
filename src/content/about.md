Hi! I’m Philip. I’m a Developer at [Sparkbox](https://sparkbox.com) with a passion for bridging design and development with a focus on HTML, CSS, and Accessibility. I’m even a certified [Web Accessibility&nbsp;Specialist](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertificants#Certificants4)!</p>

I help teach and train designers and developers through the [Sparkbox apprenticeship programs](http://apprentices.seesparkbox.com/) and as an adjunct instructor at [The Modern College of&nbsp;Design](https://themodern.edu).

My writing on various web topics can be found on the [Sparkbox Foundry](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/author/philip_zastrow) or on [my website](/posts). I also have a [tutorial series about CSS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-style-html-with-css) on the DigitalOcean Community site.

I’m always looking for a [good book](/books) to read. Lately, you can find me hanging out around the&nbsp;<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@zastrow">Fediverse</a>.
