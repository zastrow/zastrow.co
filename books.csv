"My Life in Full: Work, Family, and Our Future",Indra Nooyi,9780593191798,2024-09-01 11:30,5,"Excellent memoir by an incredible and inspiring CEO. I found Nooyi’s personal perspective from her life fascinating and inspiring as she brought those experiences to create meaningful and impactful change. Here influence was not limited to PepsiCo but beyond to the partners, workers, and even nations with which the company is involved. I think anyone can learn a lot from her story and experiences, and I think there are many opportunities to carry her work in the next generation.",Read
Against Technoableism: Rethinking Who Needs Improvement,Ashley Shew,9781324036661,2024-08-10 19:09,5,"Excellent book. When we view those with a disability of some form as needing fixed or that a technological innovation will cure them, their individuality and desires are ignored. After finishing up _Under a White Sky_, I have been very aware of how human interventions always have unintended or unexpected consequences, and technoableism is no different.",Read
Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future,Elizabeth Kolbert,9780593136287,2024-08-05 13:32,5,"I’ve read both Kolbert’s _Field Notes From a Catastrophe_ and _The Sixth Extension_, both of which highlight the effects of the Anthropocene. While _Under a White Sky_ dives more in to how as we try to solve problems, we inevitably cause more problems, which cyclically leads to more damage and more problems to solve. Kolbert explores many examples of what has been done, what is being fixe, and where we are theorizing other solutions and trying to anticipate the damage the solution may cause.",Read
The Buddha in the Attic,Julie Otsuka,9780307744425,2024-08-02 18:30,5,"Beautiful and harrowing novel told through the lives and experiences of Japanese immigrants to the Western United Stated from turn of the 20th century up to the mass detainment during World War 2. I learned so much through this book that was difficult to put down. What I found most impressive is that the protagonist is not a person but a people, with each sentence providing a perspective. ",Read
How Infrastructure Works: Inside the Systems That Shape Our World,Deb Chachra,9780593086599,2024-07-27 15:15,4,"Incredible deep dive in to the hidden systems that intertwine our everyday lives. Deb Chachra takes you all over the globe to look at what was, what is, and what could be when it comes to these systems. I was astounded by many structures she presents and equally left concerned with how societally we ignore the essentialness of these systems’ regular maintenance needs.",Read
Bad With Money,Gaby Dunn,9781501176333,2024-07-23 20:50,5,"I have considered reading this book for years. In part because I think I am bad with money, but know I know more than I give myself credit. However, Dunn’s book title instilled a honesty I never see from financial books.
Bad With Money is the perfect book for those transitioning from teenager to adult to get a level-head grip on the weird world of every day finances. It’s also a really good book for anyone just trying to figure all this shit out, because none of us fully understand it all.
What stood out to me for this book was the thesis early on as Dunn discusses the scripts we follow when it comes to money and that these scripts get instilled in us early in life as the grown-ups in our lives grapple with understanding money, too. As I read Dunn’s own account of her life and how it informed her money scripts, I realized my own money script revolved around fear and shame. Recognizing that, I hope to dig more into the roots of that.
That’s not all though, Dunn covers everything from making money, saving, investing, to the blight of the student loan system and wedding industries taking advantage of uninformed youth. Dunn also covers things you may not consider like a will and how we can be part of changing how our society relates to and perceives finances and money.
I absolutely loved Dunn’s insight and humor as she interweaved her personal story with financial insights she’s gleaned over the years. I highly recommend this book even if you feel very confident in your financial understanding as Dunn’s own perspective reminded me how differently everyone’s experience is as we figure life.",Read
"God, Human, Animal, Machine: Technology, Metaphor, and the Search for Meaning",Meghan O’Gieblyn,9780525562719,2024-07-23 12:30,4,"I was drawn to this book from the perspective as someone seeing similarities with the Posthuman/Transhuman push from the techno-authoritarians and that of Christian fundamentalism. Indeed, O’Gieblyn takes on both and more in a fascinating exploration of the metaphors that transcend humanity, religions, and systems that are religion in all but name.",Read
Women & Power: A Manifesto,Mary Beard,9781631494758,2024-06-28 21:00,5,"I have been wanting to read Mary Beard for some years ever since I learned about her book SPQR. But, I’ve put off picking up her works until now, and I’m glad this was my introduction to her work. Beard brings to the forefront how the suppression of women during ancient Greece and Rome is still alive and well in Western Civilization today.",Read

Extremely Hardcore: Inside Elon Musk’s Twitter,Zoë Schiffer ,9780593716601,2024-04-28 19:00,5,"Zoë Schiffer’s provides a deeply researched and developed account of the the moment Elon Musk tweeted he’d buy Twitter, up through the end of the first year after he took over. I found this to be a page turner that provided further depth on stories I had heard or read through her reporting on Platformer. All-in-all, it’s amazing X Corp. hasn’t announced bankruptcy as of this writing.",Read
Angelika Frankenstein Makes Her Match,Sally Thorne,9780062912831,2024-03-23 19:16,1,"I really should have realized this was necrophilia by the title. However, I thought it was in the spirit of something like *Pride and Prejudice and Zombies*. And while the main character fantasized her formerly-dead piecemeal creation vividly, there was just enough story thread to keep me going until I realized I was actively avoiding reading altogether.

In order to appease my completionist mindset, I skimmed and skipped through the remainder of the book to mark it as read. The characters lacked anything that made them the least bit interesting, and by the end I found now substantial development to the characters or the story.",Read
Sea of Tranquility ,Emily St. John Mandel,9780593466735,2024-03-01 23:55,5,quite the page turner. I had a very hard time putting this one down. Emily St. John Mandel uses pandemic as a backdrop once again to explore humanity in an even more fascinating way than *Station Eleven*. Loved it and this is high on the reread list already. ,Read
The Poppy War,R.F. Kuang,9780062662583,2024-02-26 21:58,5,"I don’t quite know what to say about this book. After this one, I want to read everything Kuang has written, and might make that a goal for the year. I will certainly have to finish the trilogy at the least. 

When I first read the premise, this seemed like it ought to be labeled YA. A young, neglected kid rises above the expectations of their abusive guardians to join an elite school and find their hidden power. But this is far beyond that stereotypical synopsis and makes itself known that it is no YA story. Here, the dangers are real, the war is grizzly, and the awkward love triangles don’t exist.

I found this to be a page turner in every way I would want. I was left so often wanting to keep reading, but also with a desire to pause and digest what I had just finished reading. Now I have to consider whether to pause and pick up a different book or the sequel. ",Read
Of Time and Turtles,Sy Montgomery,9780358458180,2024-01-20 14:00,5,"Another beautiful account from Sy Montgomery, exploring the depths of a particular group of creatures. I did not realize the very intentional threat turtles face through various acts of humanity to poach and profit. These are creatures I have long been fascinated by, and this book introduced me to people that have devoted their lives to the well-being of these slow neighbors. As Sy often does, I’m left with a new-found respect for the topical animal.",Read
Inclusive Design Communities,Sameera Kapila,9781952616150,2024-01-02 00:00,5,"A Book Apart Books always bring quality in words, ideas, and the physical product itself. The paper quality, and layout choices are of equal quality as the author, topic, and writing. Sameera’s book is no different. While it is called Inclusive Design Communities it could also be called Being an Empathetic Human. So much of her ideas and thoughts in this book transcend the tech industry and can be applied to any place humans gather.",Read
Strange Weather in Tokyo,Hiromi Kawakami,9781640090163,2024-01-01 00:00,5,Beautiful story about a woman and the relationship she builds with her childhood school teacher later in life. So much of the book ends up talking about the food at various place around Tokyo that I would have to stop reading because I got hungry.,Read
Bookshops & Bonedust,Travis Baldree,9781250886101,2023-12-30 00:00,5,"I love these books and I need Travis Baldree to keep going back to this world of low stakes, high fantasy. Even when it does get more intense, it still manages to be laid back. Great read for the end of year holidays.",Read
